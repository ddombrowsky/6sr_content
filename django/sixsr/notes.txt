  django-admin startproject sixsr
  cd sixsr
  python manage.py startapp sixsr_web

  #  generate model from DB schema
  python manage.py inspectdb

  # after that, changes to model can be sent back to the DB:
  python manage.py makemigrations sixsr_web
  python manage.py migrate

  # create initial admin
  python manage.py createsuperuser

  # start dev site
  python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000



------
python3 doesn't support mysql very well.  I've already run into problems.
Database migration to postgresql might be required early on.
I needed to find a compatible database communication engine (PyMySQL3),
and then patch it to work according to
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15314468/django-1-5-pymysql-error-importerror-cannot-import-name-thing2literal

UPDATE: django w/ python3 doesn't support mysql AT ALL.  Moving to postgresql.
